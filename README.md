# C-Number_guessing-Game
Language :- C Programming. It is a program in C language which generates a random number and asks the player to guess it. If the player's guess is higher than the actual number, the program will display message "Lower Number Please".  Similarly if the player's guess is lesser than the actual number, the program will display message "Higher Number Please". When the user guesses the correct number, the program displays the number of attempts to arrive at the number. You have unlimited attempts to guess the random number. I have used Visual Studio Code here.
